								<p> Your turn will come and Linsdey will accept you as a Direct Client. The difference between a direct client and a client is that there are ONLY Direct Clients. If you are not a Direct Client you are either waiting your turn, or you've proved incapable of waiting your turn.</p>

							<article class="from-right">
								<p>WAIT</p>
							</article>
							<article class="from-left">
								<p> Once a Direct Client you will recieve Lindsey's personal and ONLY number. By this time you will know Lindsey's rates and you will have accpeted them. Lindsey will be open any time of day (within reason) to answer any question about the case, or even just to shoot the shit, maybe play some Among Us? You're paying for Lindsey's time, you decide how you will use your turn.

								<p>*Lindsey will not do anything illegal or of a sexual nature with you during your turn*</p></p>

								<p>Once your case is won, your turn is over. You will no longer be a Direct Client. Lindsey and you will have a talk about what this means. If there is a mutual desire, you may gain the title of FRIEND. There will then be a talk about what a FRIEND is to Lindsey. Either way, you will have to pay your due and say goodbye to the perks of Direct Client.</p>

						<h2>About Lindsey</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Lindsey Vern is a Champion of the People. Lindsey has graduated from a free online law school, quicklawyer.com, and during the FOUR weeks of class Lindsey learned everything they need to know about winning any case they are presented with.</p>
	        <p>Lindsey has watched ALL THIRTEEN episodes of Law & Order: Trial By Jury and belives that it has the best theme song of them all.</p>
	        <p>Lindsey is a firm believer that what you wear, where you work from, nor where you learned from should have any impact on people taking you seriously. If you give Lindsey respect, and you wait your turn, Lindsey will take your case as seriously as a heart attack, no matter what it is. Lindsey's most famous case was between Becka (age 5) and Jenny (age 6) in a tragic case of a "No trade backs" violation. There are no small cases. In the end both were wonderful kids, but Becka waited her turn, she got Lindsey Vern, and she won the case.</p>
	        <p>Lindsey loves and respects all people, but has no respect for not waiting your turn.</p>
