          <p> Your turn will come and Linsdey will accept you as a Direct Client. The difference between a direct client and a client is that there are ONLY Direct Clients. If you are not a Direct Client you are either waiting your turn, or you've proved incapable of waiting your turn.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p> Once a Direct Client you will recieve Lindsey's personal and ONLY number. By this time you will know Lindsey's rates and you will have accpeted them. Lindsey will be open any time of day (within reason) to answer any question about the case, or even just to shoot the shit, maybe play some Among Us? You're paying for Lindsey's time, you decide how you will use your turn.

          <h6>*Lindsey will not do anything illegal or of a sexual nature with you during your turn*</h6></p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Once your case is won, your turn is over. You will no longer be a Direct Client. Lindsey and you will have a talk about what this means. If there is a mutual desire, you may gain the title of FRIEND. There will then be a talk about what a FRIEND is to Lindsey. Either way, you will have to pay your due and say goodbye to the perks of Direct Client.</p>
