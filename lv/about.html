        <p>Lindsey Vern is a Champion of the People. Lindsey has graduated from a free online law school, quicklawyer.com, and during the FOUR weeks of class Lindsey learned everything they need to know about winning any case they are presented with.</p>
        <p>Lindsey has watched ALL THIRTEEN episodes of Law & Order: Trial By Jury and belives that it has the best theme song of them all.</p>
        <p>Lindsey is a firm believer that what you wear, where you work from, nor where you learned from should have any impact on people taking you seriously. If you give Lindsey respect, and you wait your turn, Lindsey will take your case as seriously as a heart attack, no matter what it is. Lindsey's most famous case was between Becka (age 5) and Jenny (age 6) in a tragic case of a "No trade backs" violation. There are no small cases. In the end both were wonderful kids, but Becka waited her turn, she got Lindsey Vern, and she won the case.</p>
        <p>Lindsey loves and respects all people, but has no respect for not waiting your turn.</p>
